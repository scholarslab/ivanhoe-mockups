                <p>Suffragettes plotted to assassinate Herbert Asquith, the Liberal prime minister, as part of their campaign to achieve votes for women, according to a file released yesterday at the National Archives.</p>

                <p>Scotland Yard was warned that two members of the movement were perfecting their pistol shooting in the hope of killing Asquith as he arrived at the House of Commons. They were never caught.</p>
